# Additional Analysis
This folder contains complementary analyses for the hourly rainfall forecasting project. These steps support data preparation and hydrological insights but are separate from the machine learning workflow.

## Structure
1. README.md – Overview of the folder contents.
2. data_scraping_and_validation.ipynb – Notebook for web scraping rainfall data from source websites and validating it against official meteorological records.
3. hydrological_analysis/ – Contains hydrology-focused notebooks and transformed datasets:
3a. frequency_analysis.ipynb – Frequency analysis using Normal, Log-Normal, Gumbel, and Log-Pearson III distributions, with Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit testing.
3b. hourly_distribution_pattern.ipynb – Analysis of hourly rainfall distribution to identify trends and tendencies in rainfall patterns.
3c. Excel files – Transformed datasets generated by the notebooks and visualizations.

## Dependencies
These notebooks use the following Python libraries:
1. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, datetime -> data processing and visualization
2. BeautifulSoup, requests, lxml -> web scraping
3. SciPy -> probability distribution
4. Openpyxl -> reading and writing Excel files
5. Scikit-learn -> metrics calculation
